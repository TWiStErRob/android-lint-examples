Wanted to reproduce all ObsoleteLintCustomCheck possibilities in one module, but `lintChecks` configuration doesn't allow multiple jars. So I merged multiple jars into a fat jar and merged the `"Lint-Registry-v2"` attributes into the service locator file. This solution can be found by looking at the history of this file's parent folder. Now each scenario is separate module with its own jar for registry implementation.

REPORT `META-INF/services/com.android.tools.lint.client.api.IssueRegistry` doesn't support multiple registries because `com.android.tools.lint.client.api.JarFileIssueRegistry` has some inconsistent behavior: even though `findRegistries` looks through each line of the service locator file and treats each as a separate IssueRegistry in the same jar, but `JarFileIssueRegistry.Factory.get` uses a cache per jar which means only the first one will be actually loaded.
